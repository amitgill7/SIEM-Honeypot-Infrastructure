<h1>SIEM Honeypot</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved deploying a Windows virtual machine in Microsoft Azure as a honeypot to capture real-world RDP brute-force attacks. Windows Security Event logs were forwarded to Microsoft Sentinel, where failed login attempts were analyzed using KQL and enriched with geographic data. The results were visualized in a Sentinel workbook to display the global origin and frequency of attack activity.
<br />


<h2>Technology Tools Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines: Deployed a Windows-based VM configured as a honeypot to attract real-world RDP brute-force attacks.
- Microsoft Sentinel: Used as the SIEM platform for log ingestion, analysis, and security visualization.
- Azure Log Analytics Workspace: Centralized and stored Windows Security Event logs for querying and correlation.
- Kusto Query Language (KQL): Applied to filter failed RDP login attempts and enrich logs with geographic data.
- Azure Sentinel Workbooks: Created custom visualizations, including a global attack map, to display attacker locations.
- Windows Event Viewer: Collected failed authentication events (Event ID 4625) generated by RDP attacks.
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): Enabled to simulate and observe brute-force authentication attempts against the VM.

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10 Enterprise</b> (21H2)
  
- <b>(Host) Windows 11 Pro </b>(23H2)

<h2>Key Takeaways 📝</h2>

- Deploying a honeypot within a cloud-based virtual machine enables safe isolation from production environments, reducing the risk of collateral damage if the system is compromised.
- Observing real-world RDP brute-force attempts provided practical insight into attacker behavior, common attack patterns, and the global distribution of malicious activity.
- The project strengthened hands-on skills in cloud security, log analysis, KQL querying, and security visualization using enterprise SIEM tools.
